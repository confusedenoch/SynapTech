SynapTech: A Brain-Computer Interface for Language Commands
SynapTech is an open-source project that aims to provide a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for language commands using EEG data. This project includes code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning model training, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time use. The project uses Python and several libraries, including MNE, pyEEG, BrainFlow, and PyQt.

Getting Started
To get started with SynapTech, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/SynapTech.git
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt:
undefined
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the sample EEG data from [insert link to data source here] and place it in the data directory.



Run the synaptech.py script to launch the GUI:


undefined
Copy code
python synaptech.py
Follow the instructions on the GUI to record EEG data and predict language commands in real-time.
Usage
SynapTech’s GUI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Here’s a brief overview of how to use it:


Connect your EEG device to your computer and ensure it is properly configured.



Launch SynapTech by running the synaptech.py script.



Choose the EEG device and select the channels to use.



Click the “Record” button to begin recording EEG data.



Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the language command task.



After recording sufficient data, click the “Stop” button to stop recording.



Click the “Predict” button to predict the language command based on the recorded EEG data.



The predicted language command will be displayed on-screen.



To record and predict more data, repeat steps 4-8.
